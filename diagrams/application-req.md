## Database Requirements

1. **Data Security:**
      - The database must have robust security measures to protect sensitive information such as student and teacher records. This includes encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and regular security audits.
2. **Scalability:**
      - We anticipate growth in the number of students and teachers. The database should be scalable to handle increased data loads without performance degradation.
3. **Data Backup and Recovery:**
      - Regular automated data backups and a well-defined recovery process are essential to prevent data loss in case of unexpected events.
4. **Data integrity:**
      - Implement data validation and integrity checks to ensure the accuracy and reliability of information stored in the database.

## Functionality Requirements

1. **Attendance Tracking:** 
      - We need a system to track student and teacher attendance. This should include options for taking attendance, viewing historical data, and generating reports.
2. **Grade Management:**
